## Key Concepts Explained Simply

### What Are the Nuremberg Trials?
Trials of Nazi leaders after WWII where they were judged for war crimes.

### What Is Chomsky Saying?
The trials had a double standard - they only prosecuted things the enemy did, not things both sides did.

### What Did We Verify?
We checked Chomsky's claims against actual trial documents and found strong support for his main arguments.

### Why Does This Matter?
It raises questions about fairness, justice, and whether victors can fairly judge losers.
