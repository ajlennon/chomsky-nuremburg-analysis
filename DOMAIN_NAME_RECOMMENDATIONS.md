## Domain Considerations

- ❌ Numbers (confusing)
- ❌ Very long names (hard to remember)
- ❌ Abbreviations (unclear)
- ❌ Misspellings (even intentional ones)

## Setup Steps

Once you choose a domain:

1. **Register the domain**
   - Check availability at domain registrars (Namecheap, GoDaddy, Google Domains, etc.)
   - Register for at least 1-2 years

2. **Update Jekyll Configuration**
   - Update `_config.yml`:
     ```yaml
     url: "https://chomskynuremberg.org"
     baseurl: ""
     ```

3. **Configure GitHub Pages**
   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Add custom domain: `chomskynuremberg.org`
   - GitHub will provide DNS records to configure

4. **Set up DNS**
   - Add A records or CNAME as GitHub instructs
   - Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)

5. **Enable HTTPS**
   - GitHub Pages automatically provides SSL certificates
   - Enable "Enforce HTTPS" in repository settings

6. **Update Internal Links**
   - All relative URLs will work automatically
   - Update any absolute URLs if needed

## Cost Estimate

- Domain registration: ~$10-15/year (.org)
- GitHub Pages: Free (with custom domain)
- SSL Certificate: Free (via GitHub Pages)
- **Total: ~$10-15/year**

This domain name:
