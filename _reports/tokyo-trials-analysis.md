# Tokyo Trials Analysis: Chomsky's Claims Verification

**Date:** November 21, 2025  
**Status:** Analysis In Progress  
**Source Archives:** Tokyo Trial Database (tokyotrial.cn), University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries, JACAR, Hoover Institution

## Executive Summary

This analysis extends the verification of Chomsky's essay "If the Nuremberg Laws were Applied..." to include **Tokyo Trials claims**. While the Harvard Law School Library's Nuremberg Trials Project collection focuses exclusively on Nuremberg Trials, Tokyo Trials materials are available in other online archives.

**Key Finding:** We have successfully located Pal's profile and references to his dissenting judgment in the Tokyo Trial Database, confirming that Pal was indeed the only judge who found all defendants not guilty.

## Verification Results

### ✅ Partially Verified: Pal's Identity and Role (pal_001)

**Claim:** "Radhabinod Pal was the one authentic, independent Asian justice at the Tokyo tribunal, and also the one person in the court who had any background in international law"

**Status:** ✅ **Partially Verified** (50% confidence)

**Evidence Found:**
- Pal's profile page confirms he was an Indian judge at the Tokyo Tribunal
- Profile states: "在十一名法官中，他是唯一主张全体被告人无罪的法官" (Among the eleven judges, he was the only one who found all defendants not guilty)
- Profile confirms Pal's background: "1937年加入国际法协会" (Joined International Law Association in 1937), "被选为主席团团员，并担任法律哲学组的总报告人" (Selected as member of presidium and served as general rapporteur of legal philosophy group)

**Sources:**
- Tokyo Trial Database: Pal Profile Page (http://tokyotrial.cn/Person/Index/7cf1a279c0964d1cad5f160f69768cf8)

**Notes:** 
- Confirmed: Pal was the only judge who found all defendants not guilty
- Confirmed: Pal had international law background (International Law Association member)
- Need to verify: Whether Pal was the "one person in the court" with international law background (requires checking other judges' backgrounds)

### 🔍 Requires Full Document Access: Pal's Dissent Claims (pal_002, pal_004, pal_005)

**Claims:**
- Pal wrote a 700-page dissent
- Pal compared atom bombs to Nazi crimes
- Pal said atom bomb crimes cannot be attributed to the accused

**Status:** 🔍 **Requires Full Document Access**

**Evidence Found:**
- Found reference to book: "远东国际军事法庭: 法官帕尔的异议判决书" (IMTFE: Judge Pal's Dissenting Judgment)
- URL: http://tokyotrial.cn/Book/index/ca13b4bfa05b4525bce7d081d68e82a4
- Found 3 additional books about Pal's dissent and views

**Sources:**
- Tokyo Trial Database: Pal's Dissenting Judgment Book
- Tokyo Trial Database: Books about Pal's views

**Notes:**
- Full text of Pal's dissent document needed to verify:
  - Length (700 pages claim)
  - Atom bomb comparison claim
  - Statement about attribution to accused
- May require subscription access or Harvard Law Library physical access (as Chomsky mentioned)

### 🔍 Not Found: Yamashita Case (yamashita_001)

**Claim:** "General Yamashita was hanged on the grounds that troops in the Philippines, which were technically under his command (though it was so late in the war that he had no contact with them), had carried out atrocities"

**Status:** 🔍 **Not Found in Tokyo Trials Archives**

**Reason:** 
- **Important:** Yamashita was tried separately by a US military commission in the Philippines, **NOT** at the Tokyo Trials
- The Tokyo Trial Database contains only International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE) documents
- Yamashita's trial was a separate proceeding

**Next Steps:**
- Search for Yamashita trial records in separate archives
- Verify command responsibility doctrine application
- Verify claim about lack of contact with troops

### 🔍 Not Found: Tokyo Tribunal Assessment Claims (tokyo_001, tokyo_002, tokyo_003)

**Claims:**
- Tokyo tribunal was "farcical"
- US didn't care about 1930s Japanese atrocities
- US attitude toward Nanking massacre

**Status:** 🔍 **Not Found in Available Documents**

**Reason:**
- Limited transcript access (only early 1946 transcripts found)
- Full transcript search may require subscription access
- These claims may require analysis across multiple documents

**Next Steps:**
- Access full trial transcripts (subscription required)
- Search for discussions of US priorities and attitudes
- Cross-reference with historical sources
