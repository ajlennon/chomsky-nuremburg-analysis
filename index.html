            <p class="lead">
                This analysis checks whether Noam Chomsky's claims about the Nuremberg Trials are supported by actual historical documents from Harvard Law School's collection of trial records.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Think of it like fact-checking:</strong> We took Chomsky's essay, found the original trial documents, and checked if what he says matches what's in the records.

                <h3>What Chomsky Claims</h3>
                <p>Chomsky argues that the Nuremberg Trials (where Nazi leaders were tried after WWII) had a double standard:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"If the enemy did something bad, and we couldn't show we did it too, then it was a war crime. But if we did it, it wasn't a crime."</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>He says this explains why:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bombing cities wasn't considered a war crime (Allies did it too)</li>
                    <li>Some actions by the Germans were prosecuted, but similar actions by Allies weren't</li>
                </ul>
