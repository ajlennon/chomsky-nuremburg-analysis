            Verification of Noam Chomsky's essay <em>"If the Nuremberg Laws were Applied..."</em> 
            (<a href="https://chomsky.info/1990____-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chomsky.info</a>) 
            against documents from the Harvard Law School Library's Nuremberg Trials Project.

        <p class="scope-notice">
            <strong>Scope:</strong> This analysis focuses on <strong>Nuremberg Trials claims</strong> (verified) and <strong>Tokyo Trials claims</strong> (analysis in progress). Tokyo Trials analysis uses separate archives as the Harvard collection contains only Nuremberg Trials documents. <a href="{{ '/reports/tokyo-trials-analysis/' | relative_url }}">See Tokyo Trials Analysis</a> for current findings.

            <p class="lead">
                This analysis checks whether Noam Chomsky's claims about the Nuremberg Trials are supported by actual historical documents from Harvard Law School's collection of trial records.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Think of it like fact-checking:</strong> We took Chomsky's essay, found the original trial documents, and checked if what he says matches what's in the records.

                <h3>What Chomsky Claims</h3>
                <p>Chomsky argues that the Nuremberg Trials (where Nazi leaders were tried after WWII) had a double standard:</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>"If the enemy did something bad, and we couldn't show we did it too, then it was a war crime. But if we did it, it wasn't a crime."</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>He says this explains why:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bombing cities wasn't considered a war crime (Allies did it too)</li>
                    <li>Some actions by the Germans were prosecuted, but similar actions by Allies weren't</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="claim-text">"If the enemy had done it and couldn't show that we had done it, then it was a war crime"</p>

            <p class="lead">
                This project began from a long-standing interest in Chomsky's academic approach to geopolitics and power. 
                Having discovered his work decades ago, I've always been curious about the accuracy of his historical claims.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the recent release of digitized archives and the emergence of AI agentic tools, this analysis serves two purposes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Understanding:</strong> To verify Chomsky's claims against primary source documents</li>
                <li><strong>Tool Evaluation:</strong> To explore how well modern AI tools can assist in historical research and claim verification</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This represents an experiment in using AI tools to conduct rigorous historical research - testing both the capabilities 
                of these tools and the accuracy of Chomsky's historical claims.
