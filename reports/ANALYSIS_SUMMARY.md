### 🔍 Claims Not Found (Insufficient Evidence)

#### Tokyo Trials Claims (9 claims)
These claims require Tokyo Trials documents, which appear to be less well-indexed in the Harvard collection:

1. **General Yamashita Case** (1 claim)
   - Claim about Yamashita being hanged for atrocities by troops he had no contact with
   - **Status:** Not Found
   - **Note:** Requires Tokyo Trial documents, may need manual search

2. **Justice Pal Dissent** (5 claims)
   - Claims about Pal being independent Asian justice
   - Claims about Pal's 700-page dissent
   - Claims about Pal comparing atom bombs to Nazi crimes
   - **Status:** Not Found
   - **Note:** Pal's dissent is mentioned by Chomsky as being in Harvard Law Library - may require direct library access or different search approach

3. **Tokyo Tribunal Assessment** (2 claims)
   - Claims about Tokyo Tribunal being "farcical"
   - **Status:** Not Found (1 claim) / Verified (2 claims)
   - **Note:** Some Tokyo-related claims found, but specific "farcical" assessment not found

4. **Admiral Gernetz/Nimitz Case** (1 claim)
   - Claim about Gernetz case where Nimitz testified
   - **Status:** Not Found
   - **Note:** May be in Nuremberg documents but not found with current search terms

5. **American Presidents Thesis** (1 claim)
   - Chomsky's main thesis about post-war presidents
   - **Status:** Not Found
   - **Note:** This requires external historical analysis, not just Nuremberg documents

## Important Observations

### Strengths of Analysis

1. **Strong Verification:** 11 claims verified with high confidence
2. **Extensive Evidence:** Some claims have thousands of supporting excerpts
3. **No Contradictions:** No claims were contradicted by evidence
4. **Clear Patterns:** Verified claims show consistent patterns supporting Chomsky's arguments

### Limitations

1. **Tokyo Trials Coverage:** Harvard collection appears stronger on Nuremberg than Tokyo Trials
2. **Document Access:** Some documents may require direct library access (e.g., Pal's dissent)
3. **Search Limitations:** Website search may not capture all relevant documents
4. **External Sources:** Some claims require sources outside Nuremberg documents (e.g., Telford Taylor's book)

### Recommendations

1. **Manual Verification:** For high-priority claims (especially Pal dissent), manual review recommended
2. **External Sources:** Consult Telford Taylor's "Nuremberg and Vietnam" for additional verification
3. **Library Access:** Direct access to Harvard Law Library may be needed for Pal's dissent
4. **Tokyo Trials:** May need to search Tokyo Trials documents separately or use different approach

## Conclusion

The analysis found **strong evidence supporting 55% of Chomsky's claims** directly from the Nuremberg Trials documents. The verified claims particularly support Chomsky's arguments about:

- The selective application of war crime standards
- The ex post facto nature of Nuremberg principles
- The operational criterion for determining war crimes
- Telford Taylor's role and statements

The claims not found primarily relate to Tokyo Trials documents, which may require different search strategies or direct library access. Importantly, **no claims were contradicted** by the evidence found.
