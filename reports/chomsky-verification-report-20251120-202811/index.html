<h4 id="claim-taylor_003-nuremberg-principles---telford-taylor">Claim taylor_003: Nuremberg Principles - Telford Taylor</h4>

<p><strong>Claim:</strong> Taylor spells out the Nuremberg principles. They’re just the way I said. In fact, I’m taking it from him, but he doesn’t regard that as a criticism. He says, well, that’s the way we did it, and should have done it that way</p>

<p><strong>Context:</strong> Taylor’s explanation of Nuremberg principles matching Chomsky’s description</p>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> ✅ Verified (Confidence: 100.0%)</p>

<p><strong>Claim:</strong> German Admiral Gernetz - when he was brought to trial (he was a submarine commander or something) for sinking merchant vessels or whatever he did - he called as a defense witness American Admiral Nimitz who testified that the U.S. had done pretty much the same thing, so he was off, he didn’t get tried</p>

<p><strong>Claim:</strong> Many of their worst atrocities the U.S. didn’t care about. Like some of the worst atrocities of the Japanese were in the late ’30s, but the U.S. didn’t especially care about that. What the U.S. cared about was that Japan was moving to close off the China market</p>
