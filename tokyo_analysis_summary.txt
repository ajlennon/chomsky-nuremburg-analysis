TOKYO TRIALS ANALYSIS SUMMARY
================================================================================

Claims analyzed: 9
Total documents found: 21

CLAIMS:

yamashita_001: Tokyo Trials - General Yamashita
  General Yamashita was hanged on the grounds that troops in the Philippines, which were technically under his command (though it was so late in the war that he had no contact with them), had carried out atrocities

pal_001: Tokyo Trials - Justice Pal Dissent
  Radhabinod Pal was the one authentic, independent Asian justice at the Tokyo tribunal, and also the one person in the court who had any background in international law

pal_002: Tokyo Trials - Justice Pal Dissent
  Pal dissented from the whole judgment, dissented from the whole thing. He wrote a very interesting and important dissent, seven hundred pages

pal_003: Tokyo Trials - Justice Pal Dissent
  Pal's dissent can be found in the Harvard Law Library

pal_004: Tokyo Trials - Justice Pal Dissent
  Pal ends up by saying something like this: if there is any crime in the Pacific theater that compares with the crimes of the Nazis, for which they're being hanged at Nuremberg, it was the dropping of the two atom bombs

pal_005: Tokyo Trials - Justice Pal Dissent
  Pal says nothing of that sort can be attributed to the present accused

tokyo_001: Tokyo Trials - General Assessment
  The Tokyo tribunal was in many ways farcical. The people condemned at Tokyo had done things for which plenty of people on the other side could be condemned

tokyo_002: Tokyo Trials - General Assessment
  Many of their worst atrocities the U.S. didn't care about. Like some of the worst atrocities of the Japanese were in the late '30s, but the U.S. didn't especially care about that. What the U.S. cared about was that Japan was moving to close off the China market

tokyo_003: Tokyo Trials - General Assessment
  The slaughter of a couple of hundred thousand people or whatever they did in Nanking. That's not a big deal
